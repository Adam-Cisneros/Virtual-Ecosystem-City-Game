## Description

Our group project will simulate an ecosystem in which a neighboring village will interact with. Much like a city-management game, the project will want the user to make decisions on how to manipulate the ecosystem and environment around it. Some examples are chopping trees to build homes or hunting animals to get hide or food. However, the village may have to deal with certain environemtal factors such as deforestation, dwindling population of animals, and/or drought whih may depend on the season. The ecosytem will be self-managing in that as life interacts with each other the species attributes change. Examples are when a predator hunts its prey, the prey's species population will decrease and the overall nutrition of the predator's species will rise which can influence a growth in its population. Events will be time-based like, for example, every tick could be an hour and for that tick the ecosystem will update and every species will have had a chance to hunt, eat, or drink, but, every other tick the village will be able to make decisions based on their observation of their environment to make the village functional, while seasons could change every week.
