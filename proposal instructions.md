# Parameters of project

In this course you will work with a small team to create a new backend API of your own design. There are a few requirements for your backend:

    It has to be public. Don't propose something that you aren't willing to have be made public and freely available.
    It needs to require a persistence layer (in this case a relational DB).
    There needs to be read and write operations.

# Start a new github repository (just one for your entire team) and create a markdown file that has:

    Your contributors. This can be 3-4 total people, all of whom must be in your same section. Please include your calpoly email addresses.
    Description of your project. This should be 4-8 sentence pitch, not a detailed spec. Don't worry the spec will be next.
